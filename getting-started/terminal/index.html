<h2 id="terminal">The Terminal</h2>

<p>If at some point you've seen the screen of a programmer at work, it probably looks something like this:

<img src="/images/terminal.png" alt="A terminal window" style="margin: 20px auto">

<p>To non-programmers, this screen looks pretty much the same as this:

<img src="/images/matrix.png" alt="The Matrix" style="margin: 20px auto">

<p>But don't worry! One of the first things we'll do is get you acccustomed to working in the command-line environment. The program in the first picture is called a <strong>Terminal</strong>. The name comes from the days of computer when you used a physical monitor and keyboard connected to a mainframe, that looked something like this:</p>

<img src="/images/mainframe-terminal.jpg" alt="Mainframe Terminal" />

<p>As computers advanced in capability, you could run a terminal emulator, which just a program that emulates the physical terminal. Over the years, the use of a command-line interface has still proved to be useful for programmers.</p>

<p>Mac OS X comes with a terminal program named <strong>Terminal</strong> and it works fine, but I recommend a free alternative called <strong>iTerm 2</strong>. Download iTerm 2 from <a href="http://www.iterm2.com">www.iterm2.com</a> and <a href="/getting-started/installing-applications#copy-app">copy the application into your Applications folder</a>. Once you launch iTerm, it will look something like this:</p>

<center><img src="/images/iterm.png" alt="iTerm" /></center>

<p>Notice the cursor is positioned just after the <code>$</code> character. This is called the <strong>prompt</strong>. You can type something there and press enter and the terminal will run your program, display the output. Throughout the rest of this book, when you should do something at the command-line, you will see this:</p>
