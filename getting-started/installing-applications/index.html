<p>Now that you have your <a href="/introduction#what-you-need">Mac running the latest version of OS X</a>, let's go over how to get it set up for web application development. One thing that you will need to do is install applications on your Mac. There are a few different ways to install applications, each of which are covered in this section.

<h2 id="copy-app">Copying the application file into the Applications folder</h3>

<p>For some applications, the download will simply be the application file, possibly compressed. If you download the application using <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari" target="_blank">Safari</a>, the application will automatically be decompressed when it gets download. In this case, you use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)" target="_blank">Finder</a> to go to your Downloads folder, and then application file into the Applications folder. This is how you install the Alfred application that we will install in the next section.

<h2 id="disk-image">Copying the application file into the Applications folder from a disk image</h3>

<p>For some applications, instead of downloading the application file, you download a disk image, which is a file that ends in <code>.dmg</code>. Once the disk image has downloaded, you double-click that in Finder to mount it, and then you will have a window to drag the application into your applications folder. Once you have installed the application, you can eject the disk in Finder and delete the <code>.dmg</code> file that was downloaded.

<p>To see a good example of this, go to <a href="http://getfirefox.com" target="_blank">getfirefox.com</a>. They have good instructions there with photos to guide you through the process. This is one of the most common ways to install software on a Mac. Go ahead and follow those instructions now, we'll add some plugins to Firefor later to make it a good browser for development.

<h2 id="installer">Running an installer</h3>

<p>Some applications come packaged as an installer that you run, which may set up some system settings in addition to installing the application. We will see an example of this later.

<h2 id="app-store">From the Mac App Store</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/app-store.html" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a> allows you to search for applications, pay for them and install them. We will see an example of this later. This is a common way of installing application that you have to pay for, because you can pay for them using you Apple account directly in the app store.

<h2 id="brew">From the command line using Homebrew</h3>

<p>The last method for installing programs that I'll mention is homebrew. We will cover homebrew in a later section, but it is used to install programming using the command line. These are typically programs that are not technically applications, they are programs you run from the command line.
