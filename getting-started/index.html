<p>Before we start doing any real programming, let's get some tools installed and configured. The following sections contain tips on how to use your Mac and instructions on how to install the applications you'll need in order to do development on your Mac. Some of these instructions are not technically required, but I suggest trying them out. Even if you find that you don't like some of these configurations, it's a good idea to learn the basics of getting around on your Mac and customizing it to work better for you. As you become more comfortable with your Mac, see how others work, read other tips, you'll gradually come up with your own optimal way of configurating your environment.</p>
