<h2 id="about-this-tutorial">About this tutorial</h2>

<p>This guide is intended to teach people who have no previous programming experience how to build web-based applications.

<h2 id="what-is-a-web-application">What is a web applicaion?</h2>

<p>Good question! A web site is a collection of web pages that link together. Web sites are purely informational. No programming is required to build web sites, only knowledge of HTML and possibly CSS. A web application allows the user to interact with the web site, by entering information into a form, displaying information from a database, etc. What you are reading right now is just a web site. <a href="http://gmail.com" target="_blank">GMail</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> are examples of web applications. <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> is a framework that was built to help you build web applications.

<h2 id="its-more-than-just-ruby-on-rails">It's more than just Ruby on Rails</h2>

<p>Without any prior programming experience, learning on Ruby on Rails can be very challenging. One of the biggest reasons why is that you need to know many other things besides just Ruby on Rails. This guide starts you out with the basics to give you a good foundation to build on.

<h2 id="what-you-need">What you need</h2>

<p>By far, the most common platform developers building Ruby on Rails use is <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx" target="_blank">Mac OS X</a><sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. These instructions will only cover how to use a Mac. If you only have a Windows or Linux PC to use for development, you may be able to follow some other tutorials online about how to get things installed and up and running and then follow the rest of this guide, but I recommend getting a Mac.

<p>The instructions for this guide also cover the latest verison of Mac OS X, which is 10.9 Mavericks. Mavericks is a free upgrade, available in the Mac App Store, so make sure you have installed that before proceeding.
